# povmap: Extension to the emdi package for small area estimation

The R package povmap is designed to facilitate the production of small area estimates
of means and poverty headcount rates. It adds several new features to the emdi package.
These include new options for incorporating survey weights, ex-post benchmarking of
estimates, two additional transformations, several new convenient functions to assist with
reporting results, and a wrapper function to facilitate access from Stata.
