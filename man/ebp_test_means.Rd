\alias{ebp_test_means}
\title{Perform test for difference between survey and census means}
\usage{
ebp_test_means(varlist, smp_data, pop_data, weights = NULL, pop_weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{varlist}{character vector, the set of variables of interest}

\item{smp_data}{the survey data}

\item{pop_data}{the population data}

\item{weights}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates weights in the sample data. If a character string is provided
a weighted version of the ebp will be used. The variable has to be numeric.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{pop_weights}{a character string containing the name of a variable that
indicates population weights in the populatation data. If a character string
is provided weighted indicators are estimated using population weights.
The variable has to be numeric. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}
}
\description{
This function computes weighted means of the same set of variables within the
census and the survey. A test for difference of the means are performed for
each variable with two-tailed p-values returned.
