Description: The R package povmap is designed to facilitate the production of 
  small area estimates of means and poverty headcount rates. It adds several 
  new features to the emdi package. These include new options for incorporating 
  survey weights, ex-post benchmarking of estimates, two additional 
  transformations, several new convenient functions to assist with reporting 
  results, and a wrapper function to facilitate access from Stata.
